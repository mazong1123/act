My project is heavily using fabricjs. However, some events and objects such as double click event, right click event, video and audio obejcts are missing in fabricjs. I decided to start a <a title="Fabric.ext" href="https://github.com/mazong1123/fabric.ext" target="_blank">fabric.ext</a> project on github to impelment these missing features. Hope that will help you as well.

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: I'm not going to include video/audio objects in this project as of our privacy. However, events and any other objects would be included.

Any feedback is welcome :)
