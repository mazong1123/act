## InfoPath Analyzer is open source now

Well, finally I made this decision. The source code is now hosted on [github](https://github.com/mazong1123/infopathanalyzer "InfoPath Analyzer"). There are couple of reasons for opening the source code of IA:

1. Microsoft stopped the development of InfoPath. There is no roadmap of it, says, InfoPath retired.

2. InfoPath is still being used in the world. Alternative solutions are coming out these years.

3. I was a C# guy as the time of building IA. It's been a long time since then I've changed my career to dive into the open source world.

4. Currently, I become the bottleneck of IA. Open the source code of IA would be helpful not only for the InfoPath users, but also for the growth of e-form industry.

Hope it helps you guys :)
