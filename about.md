Hello, I'm Jim, AKA [mazong1123](https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=yXwcVqHPBqug8wfx-ouYBQ&gws_rd=cr&fg=1#q=mazong1123 "mazong1123").

I'm a developer who loves all tech from front-end to back-end including Linux and Windows. I started coding when I was 9. I still remember I made my first game by using Basic 1.0 on a China's famouse game console - Xiao Ba Wang. Since then, I used a lot of programming language - C, C++, PASCAL, C#, Java, PHP, JavaScript, etc and never stopped my coding journey.

I used to be a game hacker in the university. [TsubasaHack](https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=yXwcVqHPBqug8wfx-ouYBQ&gws_rd=cr&fg=1#q=tsubasahack+ver1.1b) , one of the best Captain Tsubasa 2 hacking tools in the world, came out from my dorm.

I'm also an open source guy. Fork me at [Github](http://www.github.com/mazong1123).

Want to know me more about project expierences and technical stuffs? Please check out [my resume](http://mazong1123.github.io/), which is based on [RatchetPro.JS](https://github.com/mazong1123/ratchet-pro), one of my open source projects. (Note: Open my resume on your mobile device to get the bese experience).
